Chapter 1, Day 1


Blockchain is a decentralized database that anyone can view and interact with. 

A smart contract is data that stores parameters and makes changes to the blockchain with a function that anyone can call. 

A transaction is a paid function call that changes the data on the blockchain and costs money depending on which blockchain you are on.
A script only views the blockchain and cannot make changes to it and doesn't cost money.

Chapter 1, Day 2

What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

Safey and security, clarity, approachability, developer experience, resource oriented programming

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

The 5 pillars could be useful for the overall experience of the blockchain to be a good experience.
